# My very first web page

Welcome! [Code Institute] (https://codeinstitute.net)

I have created this project to practice what I have learnt so far from Code Institute "Diploma in Web Application Development" course.
This project is based on a walkthrough from "User Centric Fronted Development". In particular the following technologies were employed here:
HTML, CSS, GIT, GITPOD, GITHUB, and MARKDOWN.
